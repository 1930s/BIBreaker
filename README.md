# BI Breaker

BI Breaker is a Chrome extension to get you past the Business Insider Prime paywall. This is not a hack. Business Insider Prime's paywall is just an HTML modal. This extension simply removes the modal, and changes the class of one element to allow scrolling.

The release of this extension comes with an open critique and invitation to Business Insider: Your UX is horrible. I'd like to help you fix it for free because I actually like your content. Just message me.

## Reliability

So far I have spent a total of ~45 minutes on this project so it is extremely rudimentary. The "tests" have consisted of just me clicking a few times on various BI Prime articles. It seems to work. Feel free to make an issue if you're having difficulties.

## Why?

I'm glad you asked. BI's site currently provides a terrible UX with spam-like ad inundation, promoted articles to their paywall, and a paywall that regularly fails to allow people to log in. So, I built this extension to show just how bad it is. I like a lot of the BI content and want to support paid journalism. For that reason, if someone from BI would like to reach out, I'd be happy to help you fix your paywall if you also let me help fix your UX. Once we cleanup the subscription process, I'll become a paying customer.
